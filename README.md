# Winch Launch Helper

This project comes from an old project I had done to display attitude and heading during flight as an experiment with SwiftUI. After some live tests, I noticed that the device suffered too much from the problem of hysteresis, making it less useful in practical use. However, having recently obtained the "Winch Launch" certification with the glider, I wondered if, during those brief seconds of launch, I could create a helper that would alert me in case of too pronounced errors (e.g., not respecting the minimum speed before transition or making too abrupt transitions). The project was born with the idea of evaluating whether it is possible to achieve something useful (and safe) while continuing to have fun with SwiftUI.
